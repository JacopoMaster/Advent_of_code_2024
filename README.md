## 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎅

Welcome to the **Advent of Code 2024**! Every day until Christmas, we’ll tackle new coding challenges to spread holiday cheer (and maybe a bit of debugging frustration). You can find the daily puzzles at: [https://adventofcode.com/2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). 🎁

### 📂 What's in the Bag?
This repository will be filled with my Python solutions, neatly organized by day. Each folder is like a little Christmas gift sometimes easy to open, sometimes wrapped in layers of complexity. 🎁🎅

### 🎅 Instructions
1. Visit the Advent of Code site and grab your daily puzzle.
2. Watch me *attempt* to solve it with festive Python magic. 🌟  
3. Feel free to laugh at my mistakes (Santa does too). 🎄

### 🛷 Warning
- May contain reindeer-themed variable names.  
- Side effects include sudden bursts of Christmas spirit and cravings for cookies. 🍪

Oh oh oh, Merry Coding and Happy Holidays! 🎅🎄✨
